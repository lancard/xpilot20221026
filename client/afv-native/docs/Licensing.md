# Licensing: Infrequently (but important) Asked Questions

## What is the License for AFV-Native?

AFV-Native is released under the 3-Clause BSD License.

## Does this mean I need to publish my client's source?

No.

## Do I have to leave the copyright notices intact

Yes.  This is a hard requirement of the license.  You must also include the license text (it's in `COPYING.md`) in your
distribution somewhere, clearly attributing it to AFV-Native.

## Is there anything else relevant?

* Please don't use the testclient to connect to the live network.  I mostly use it for testing the client using a
  private server setup.
  
* Please do not distribute testclient binaries.

* Please submit changes and fixes as Pull Requests on github.
